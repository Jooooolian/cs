Description:                                                                    
This collection of programs converts infix to postfix using stacks and doubly linked lists of char and double data types.

Acknowledgement:                                                                
I used the C++ reference to learn about the assert keyword: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/
This was used when a user tried to pop from an empty stack etc...

Compile with:
g++ -ansi -pedantic -Wall doublelist.cxx doublestack.cxx charlist.cxx charstack.cxx calculator.cxx operator_string.o -o calculator

Then run with:
./calculator

The program compiles and succesfully completes all test cases. 
I implemented all missing member functions etc in the following: 
doublestack.h
calculator.cxx
charlist.cxx
charlist.h
charstack.cxx
charstack.h
doublelist.cxx
doublelist.h
doublestack.cxx
