This collection of programs conerts infix to postfix using stacks and doubly linked lists of char and double data types.

Compile with:

I used the C++ reference to learn about the assert keyword: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cassert/assert/
This was used when a user tried to pop from an empty stack.
